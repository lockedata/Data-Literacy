## Planning data capture
- What information do you need to perform the associated task?
- What types of analysis are you expecting to do?
- Do you **REALLY** need that personally identifiable info?
- What data types do I need and which fields can come from a constrained list?
- What things can I do to make it easier to for folks to complete the form?
- What audit data do I need?

## Demo
