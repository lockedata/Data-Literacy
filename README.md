# Data Literacy Course

## Course Overview

### Aim of Course
The aim of this course is to provide a solid foundation for understanding data, how to collect it, how to manage it, how to manipulate it, and how to get value from it. The course will be aimed at people with little to no prior knowledge of data, and aims to ensure they are confident handling data, and have the solid understanding needed to be able to further persue their understanding once the course is complete.

The course will use Excel, and data brought into Excel from other sources, to provide a singluar environment for learning the basics of data, though students will be provided access to resources should they wish to learn other methods, such as R, later.
