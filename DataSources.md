# Data sources and how to use them

## Power BI online data sources
Power BI has a number of content packas that are "ready to go" for making dashboards easily. You can also upload your data and build reports online. You have less ability to tinker with data and create connected up datasets this way.

## Exercises
1. Use the online version to upload the `heroes_information.csv`
2. Use the *Quick Insights* feature to see what Power BI pulls out of the data
3. In the Power BI app, import the `heroes_information.csv` and clean up the data as part of the import
4. In the app, also load the `heroes_powers.csv`
5. Link the two datasets together
    + Hint: Use the `Keep Rows` transformation to de-duplicate data
