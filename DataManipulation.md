# Data Manipulation
We've briefly touched on this already, but in this section we'll take a deeper look at Data Manipulation. When we get data into Power BI it may well not be ideal for working with; it may be ideally structured for storage, but not for reporting, or we may have difficulty matching up certain values due to data formatting. Data maipulation is the step in which we'll set all this right, and make sure that our data works the way we need it to.

## Transformations
Firstly, we'll need to make transformation to the way the data is structured, and the format it's in 

### Commonly used options
### Undoing changes
### Best practices
### Demos
Import some data and use many of the transformations. Make sure to roll some back.



## Calculated columns and measures
Calculated columns are extra values added to your data set. Use these when you need columns to appear in rows and groups as headers, or for making joins. Use measures when you want to perform calculations like sum of sales. 

### Creating calculated columns
### Creating measures 
### Demos
- Create a calculated column that returns the first name of a superhero
- Create a measure that returns the average ratio of height and weight

## Writing formulae
### References
### Conditional calculations
### Common functions
### Error handling
### Best practices
### Demos
- Revisit the formulae written in previous demo
- Show the intellisense and DAX Studio for extra help

## Exercises
1. Make sure columns that count as measures are handled as such
2. Tidy up formatting and column names
3. Look up the formula for BMI and add BMI as a calculated column
4. Create a high, medium, low BMI category column
